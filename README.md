# BookMyWheel
BookMyWheel is a web-based car rental management system designed to simplify and automate the process of vehicle booking and rental services. Traditional car rental systems often rely on manual coordination, phone-based bookings, and paper records, which can lead to inefficiencies, booking conflicts, and poor customer experience. This project overcomes these challenges by providing a centralized digital platform for managing vehicles, customers, bookings, and payments efficiently.<br>
<br>
The system offers separate modules for customers and administrators, ensuring role-based access and secure data handling. Customers can browse available vehicles, view pricing details, make bookings, and manage their reservations online, while administrators can add and manage vehicles, track bookings, handle customer details, monitor availability, and generate rental reports. This structured approach reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and enhances transparency in rental operations.<br>

1.1 Project Overview
BookMyWheel is a digital car rental management system developed to simplify and streamline vehicle rental operations. It provides a centralized platform for managing vehicle listings, customer records, bookings, payments, and rental history. The system replaces traditional manual booking methods with an efficient, accurate, and transparent web-based application that benefits both customers and rental service administrators.<br>
<br>
1.2 Project Background
In many car rental businesses, bookings and vehicle management are still handled through phone calls, paperwork, or basic spreadsheets. This traditional approach often leads to issues such as booking conflicts, difficulty in tracking vehicle availability, delayed payment records, and inefficient customer service. As demand for rental vehicles grows, managing operations manually becomes increasingly complex, highlighting the need for an automated system that can handle all rental activities effectively.<br>
<br>
1.3 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop BookMyWheel, a car rental management system that automates routine rental processes and provides accurate, real-time information to both customers and administrators. The system aims to reduce manual effort, save time, improve booking accuracy, and enhance transparency in vehicle rental operations.
